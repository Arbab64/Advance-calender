# Advance-calender

Create a desktop python app that, can provide the advanced functionalities that are not generally available in the default calendar module.
When run, the application should be able to ascertain the current day, date, month and year using the existing modules (Ex. Calendar) but the rest of the functionalities should be purely computed based on the algorithm and the flow of thoughts captured in the problem statement.

The application design should follow the below guidelines:
• The application should be able to run with or without command line parameters.
• When the application is run without command line parameters, it should simply print
the current month’s calendar with current date highlighted.
• The Month and Year should appear on the top (for example, May 2020)
• The Days should appear in the next row (for example: Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa)
